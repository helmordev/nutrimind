# Phase 1 — Foundation, Auth & Account Chain

> **Milestone:** 10% | **Timeline:** 2 Days (Sprint)
> **Goal:** Functional demo for capstone technical panel showing the full account creation chain and basic dashboard access.

---

## Demo Scenario

```
SuperAdmin logs into /admin
  -> Creates a Teacher account (username + temp password)
Teacher logs into /teacher
  -> Forced to change password on first login
  -> Creates a Student account (LRN + auto-generated PIN)
  -> Views/prints credential slip
Student authenticates via API
  -> POST /api/v1/auth/login with LRN + PIN -> receives Sanctum token
  -> GET /api/v1/student/worlds -> returns 3 worlds with seeded data
  -> GET /api/v1/student/sync/state -> returns basic state payload
```

**Deliverable:** Laravel connected to MySQL 8; `migrate:status` runs clean.

### Task 3: All Database Migrations (17+ tables)

Run in this order to satisfy foreign key constraints:

- [ ] `users` — role (string, cast via `UserRole` enum), full_name, username, password, grade, section, teacher_id, is_active, must_change_password
- [ ] `student_profiles` — user_id FK, lrn (unique, 12 chars), pin (hashed), pin_generated_at, last_login_at
- [ ] `student_preferences` — user_id FK, language, volumes (master/bgm/sfx), tts_enabled, text_size, colorblind_mode

- [ ] Create `StudentLoginRequest.php` — validate `lrn` (required, 12 digits) and `pin` (required, 6 digits)
- [ ] Lookup user by LRN via `student_profiles` table
- [ ] Verify PIN with `Hash::check()` against stored hash
- [ ] Check `is_active` flag — reject inactive accounts
- [ ] Issue Sanctum token on success; return token + student basic info
- [ ] Update `last_login_at` on student profile
- [ ] Create `logout()` method — revoke current token
- [ ] Register routes in `routes/api.php`:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (public)

- [ ] Apply rate limiting: 5 attempts/minute on login

**Deliverable:** Student can authenticate via API and receive a token.

### Task 7: Web Session Authentication (Teacher + Admin)

- [ ] Create `WebAuthController.php` with `showLogin()`, `login()`, `logout()`
- [ ] Create `WebLoginRequest.php` — validate username + password
- [ ] Login checks `role` — redirects to `/admin/dashboard` or `/teacher/class`
- [ ] Session-based auth using Laravel's built-in session driver
- [ ] Register routes in `routes/web.php`:
  - `GET /login` — login form
  - `POST /login` — authenticate
  - `POST /logout` — destroy session

**Deliverable:** Teacher and Admin can log in via web browser and get redirected to their dashboards.

### Task 8: Role-Based Middleware (3 Guards)

- [ ] Create `EnsureIsStudent.php` — checks `$request->user()->role === UserRole::Student`; returns 403 JSON if not
- [ ] Create `EnsureIsTeacher.php` — checks role is `UserRole::Teacher`; redirects to login if web, 403 if API
- [ ] Create `EnsureIsSuperAdmin.php` — checks role is `UserRole::SuperAdmin`; redirects to login if web, 403 if API
- [ ] Register all three in `bootstrap/app.php` (Laravel 13 middleware registration)
- [ ] Apply to route groups:
  - `/api/v1/student/*` -> `auth:sanctum` + `EnsureIsStudent`
  - `/teacher/*` -> `auth` + `EnsureIsTeacher`
  - `/admin/*` -> `auth` + `EnsureIsSuperAdmin`

**Deliverable:** Unauthorized access returns proper 403/redirect responses.

- [ ] Create `resources/views/teacher/students/index.blade.php` (redirect to class for now)

**Deliverable:** Teacher sees their student list and can navigate to student creation.

### Task 16: Postman Collection

- [ ] Create Postman collection: `NutriMind API v1`
- [ ] Add environment variables: `base_url`, `student_token`, `admin_session`
- [ ] Document all Phase 1 endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — with sample LRN + PIN
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — with Bearer token
  - `GET /api/v1/student/worlds` — with Bearer token
  - `GET /api/v1/student/sync/state` — with Bearer token
- [ ] Include expected response schemas as examples
- [ ] Export collection as JSON to `docs/postman/NutriMind_API_v1.json`

**Deliverable:** Complete Postman collection for all Phase 1 API endpoints.

### Task 17: Smoke Test — End-to-End Verification

- [ ] **Fresh start test:** `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` runs without errors
- [ ] **Admin login:** Log in as `registrar` via web -> dashboard loads
- [ ] **Create teacher:** Admin creates a teacher -> temp password displayed
- [ ] **Teacher login:** Teacher logs in with temp password -> forced to change password
- [ ] **Password change:** Teacher changes password -> redirected to class page
- [ ] **Create student:** Teacher creates a student -> credential slip shows LRN + PIN
- [ ] **Student API login:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with LRN + PIN -> token returned
- [ ] **Worlds fetch:** `GET /api/v1/student/worlds` with token -> 3 worlds with levels returned
- [ ] **Sync state:** `GET /api/v1/student/sync/state` with token -> full state payload returned
- [ ] **Role enforcement:** Student token cannot access `/admin` or `/teacher`; teacher session cannot access `/admin`
- [ ] **Rate limiting:** 6th rapid login attempt returns 429 Too Many Requests
- [ ] Document any issues found and resolve before marking Phase 1 complete

**Deliverable:** The full account chain works end-to-end; demo-ready for capstone panel.
